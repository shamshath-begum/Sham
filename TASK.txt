TASK 01:
Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 

               HTTP/1.1                                              HTTP/2
1.It works on the textual format.                                 It works on the binary protocol. 

2.There is head of line blocking that blocks all the              It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection  
requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.           is required for multiple requests.

3.It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting              It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all 
   multiple pages.                                                    multiple pages 

4.It compresses data by itself.                                   It uses HPACK for data compression.




OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION:

  OBJECTS:Objects in JavaScript is defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types,
           in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and 
           methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Creating Objects In JavaScript :
  Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal:
          One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values
          inside curly braces as shown below

let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};

Create JavaScript Object with Constructor:
          Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple 
          objects of same flavor as shown below
eg:
function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Fiesta
console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santa Fe
